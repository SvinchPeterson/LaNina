That dream was fulfilled when our family travelled to Georgia, an amazing paradise blessed with natural wonders. We had a magical experience playing in the snow, immersed with Georgian culture, getting to know amazing Georgian people and enjoyed local food. We had a very comfortable excursion thanks to our lovely guide Salome from BB travel. She is fluent in english who knows their country's rich history well and is detailed oriented who carefully planned the entire duration of the trip from booking of flights to visa application. She followed up with Georgian consul to ensure my parents will get their visas on time. We had also pleasant experience staying at BB residence, it is a service apartment furnished with basic home appliances. Location is also good as it is strategically located at the city centre and very near to famous tourist spots in Georgia. Overall I would recommend BB travel for their flight, transfers, tour and accommodation package. It is indeed a value for money.` }

She never tries to oversell anything and it gives her genuine profession advice. George was a very good driver. He helped us with our luggages and even open the door for us.
          From the beginning of the trip to our last day I can say that we had a good experience and we will definitely recommend BB travel.
          I hope that everyone sees the review and books their trip with BB travel. You will definitely enjoy your travel with an affordable price. Happy Traveling!` }
